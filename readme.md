A repository for all my Python scripts and snippets and one-off programs

### Setup
To use on Mac or Linux, setup a virtual environment.

    clone
    virtualenv venv
    . venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Each directory is self-contained (with the exception of the virtual environment).
